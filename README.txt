========

This is a simple backup solution for my personal use designed to fit my needs.

The planned functionality is:
[x] Ability to easily generate .tar archives of a directory quickly and write to another directory.
[x] Output archives with automatic timestamping.
[x] Gzip compression.
[x] Decent GUI front-end.
[ ] XZ/Bzip2/RAR/Zip compression.

Dependencies: (x64 built binaries are included in repository)
* libarchive https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive
* zlib https://www.zlib.net/

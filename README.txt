This is a simple backup solution for my personal use designed to fit my needs.

The planned functionality is:
* Ability to easily generate .tar archives of a directory quickly and write to another directory.
* Output archives with automatic timestamping.
* XZ/Gzip/Bzip2/RAR/Zip compression.

Useful third-party code included in this repository:
* https://github.com/lindenb/cclindenb for tarball archiving capabilities.
